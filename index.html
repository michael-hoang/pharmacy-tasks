          Send an email to the refill team, copying PV2 and supervisors,
          providing the refill call goals for the day. Additionally, include
          any remaining refill calls from previous days and remind them to
          review the Refill Review queue and resolve any pending requests in WAM.

        <h3>Update Shipping Dashboard</h3>
        <p>Count the DCS and FedEx shipments for the upcoming 5 business days
          from the WAM Shipping queue (custom queue), and proceed to update the
          numbers in the Excel spreadsheet available at the following link:

        <h3>Receive Drop Ship</h3>
        <p>In the morning, FedEx drop ship packages are directly delivered to the
          Outpatient Pharmacy, while UPS drop ship packages are typically
          delivered to the Inpatient Pharmacy. UPS packages usually consist of
          drugs sourced from Amerisourcebergen's alternative distribution center,
          directly from the manufacturer (such as Prevymis, Tukysa, and
          manufacturer replacements), and some third-party vendor drugs (like Aubagio).
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are any missing packages, check with the Inpatient Pharmacy
          store room staff and the dock. If the packages are not found, contact
          the infusion pharmacy and IDS pharmacy to see if they have received
          our missing packages.
