          FedEx packages are delivered to Outpatient Pharmacy, while UPS
          packages are delivered to Inpatient Pharmacy. Drugs that are
          coming from Amerisourcebergen's alternative distribution center,
          the manufacturer (i.e. Ninlaro, Prevymis, drug replacements), and some
          third-party vendors (i.e. Aubagio from Optum Frontier Therapies) usually
          get delivered via UPS.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any missing packages, check with Inpatient Pharmacy store room
          staff and the dock. If the packages are not found, contact Infusion
          Pharmacy and IDS pharmacy to see if they have received
          our missing packages.

          The tracking number can be accessed on the ABC Order website under
          <span class="italic-text tooltip">Ordering > Order History

          When scanning drugs into Epic Inventory, prioritize the ones that are
          pending from the <span class="tooltip">FOA<span class="tooltip-text" id="foa">
          Fill on arrival </span></span> area. Ensure that both the lot number and

          Include the quantity received, purchase order (PO) number, lot number, and

        <h4>Confirming Invoices</h4>

        <p>
          To ensure timely delivery, submit drop ship orders by 1 PM from
          Monday through Thursday. With the exception of urgent FOA orders, it is
          best to avoid submitting drop ship orders on Fridays to avoid potential
          delivery exceptions as the weekend approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drop ship drugs are identified in the ABC Order catalog with the
          <span class="italic-text">DROPSHIP</span> label or the
          <span class="italic-text">Ship separately</span> indicator.

          Many drugs can be purchased from both the 340b and RAC accounts.
          However, certain drugs are exclusively available from the 340b account,
          requiring verification of 340b accumulation on
          <a href="https://web.mhiapps.com/" target="_blank">Macro Helix</a>.
          These exclusively 340b drugs can be identified in the ABC Order catalog by the
          absence of the RAC price tag.
        </p>
        <img src="img/340b_exclusive.png" alt="">
        <p>
          Before submitting the order, check the drop ship FOA area to ensure
          that all FOA drugs have been included in the order draft. On Macro Helix, search
          each requested drug by NDC for any 340b accumulation. The number of
          accumulation represents the quantity of drug packages available for
          340b purchase, and it is recalculated every 24 hours. Macro Helix
          will process any order quantity that exceeds the 340b
          accumulation through our RAC account. 
        </p>
        <img src="img/accumulation.png" alt="">
        <p>
          While checking accumulations, make any necessary adjustments to the order
          quantity. Remember to check the drug shelves and the refrigerator for
          any shortages or overstocks. In urgent cases where FOA drugs cannot wait
          for 340b accumulations, they should be ordered through RAC, if available.
          If there is an opportunity for 340b cost saving, transfer the drug to
          a new drop ship draft and await the next recalculation of 340b accumulations.
          Not all patients are eligible for 340b, so it is important to cross-reference
          the recent encounter locations and the locations where prescriptions were written
          to confirm eligibility. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After reviewing the accumulations, click submit to transmit the order
          from Epic to ABC. Open the order in ABC and punch out to <span class="italic-text">

          Ordering
        </h4>
        <p>
          To purchase any third-party drugs, a purchase order (PO) number from
          administration is required. Frequently used drugs such as Aubagio and
          Iclusig have their own specific <span class="tooltip">blanket PO numbers
          <span class="tooltip-text" id="blanket-po">A blanket purchase order (PO)
          number is a type of purchase order used in procurement processes. It is
          a single PO that covers multiple transactions or purchases over a specific
          period of time, typically for recurring or ongoing supplies or services.
          </span></span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Technicians place requests for these drugs in the comments of the drop
          ship draft. Check if the drug will be ordered from the 340B or WAC
          accounts. Send an email to the administration staff, including Michael
          Vega and Diana Ornelas, and make sure to copy supervisors and the
          compliance officer. In the email, provide the drug name, NDC, quantity,
          vendor, account number, unit cost, total cost, and our cost center
          (7427173). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the PO number is received from administration, complete the order
          form and send it to the vendor via email or fax. Order forms and PO
          documents are in the Inventory > Drugs folder within the Shared Drive.
