        <p>
          FedEx packages are delivered to Outpatient Pharmacy, while UPS
          packages are delivered to Inpatient Pharmacy. Drugs that are
          coming from Amerisourcebergen's alternative distribution center,
          the manufacturer (i.e. Ninlaro, Prevymis, drug replacements), and some
          third-party vendors (i.e. Aubagio from Optum Frontier Therapies) usually
          get delivered via UPS.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any missing packages, check with Inpatient Pharmacy store room
          staff and the dock. If the packages are not found, contact Infusion
          Pharmacy and IDS pharmacy to see if they have received
          our missing packages.

          The tracking number can be accessed on the ABC Order website under
          <span class="italic-text tooltip">Ordering > Order History
          <span class="tooltip-img"><img src="img/order_history.png" alt=""></span></span>.

        <h3>Updating Inventory</h3>
        <p>
          When scanning drugs into Epic Inventory, prioritize the ones that are
          pending from the <span class="tooltip">FOA<span class="tooltip-text" id="foa">
          Fill on arrival </span></span> area. Ensure that both the lot number and
          expiration date are recorded. Manually update the inventory for
          third-party vendor drugs and drugs that cannot be scanned into Epic.
          Include the quantity received, purchase order (PO) number, lot number, and
          expiration date in the comments.
        </p>
        <h3>Confirming Invoices</h3>
        <p>
          Confirm the invoices in Epic for the received drugs, and record the

        <h2>Ordering Drop Ship</h2>
        <p>
          To ensure timely delivery, submit drop ship orders by 1 PM from
          Monday through Thursday. With the exception of urgent FOA orders, it is
          best to avoid submitting drop ship orders on Fridays to avoid potential
          delivery exceptions as the weekend approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drop ship drugs are identified in the ABC Order catalog with the
          <span class="italic-text">DROPSHIP</span> or the
          <span class="italic-text">Ship separately</span> label. 
        </p>

          Many drugs can be purchased from both the 340b and RAC accounts.
          However, certain drugs are exclusively available from the 340b account,
          requiring verification of 340b accumulation on
          <a href="https://web.mhiapps.com/" target="_blank">Macro Helix</a>.
          These exclusively 340b drugs can be identified in the ABC Order catalog by the
          absence of the RAC price tag.
        </p>
        <img src="img/340b_exclusive.png" alt="">
        <p>
          Before submitting the order, check the drop ship FOA area to ensure
          that all FOA drugs have been included in the order draft. On Macro Helix, search
          each requested drug by NDC for any 340b accumulation. The number of
          accumulation represents the quantity of drug packages available for
          340b purchase, and it is recalculated every 24 hours. Macro Helix
          will process any order quantity that exceeds the 340b
          accumulation through our RAC account. 
        </p>
        <img src="img/accumulation.png" alt="">
        <p>
          While checking accumulations, make any necessary adjustments to the order
          quantity. Remember to check the drug shelves and the refrigerator for
          any shortages or overstocks. In urgent cases where FOA drugs cannot wait
          for 340b accumulations, they should be ordered through RAC, if available.
          If there is an opportunity for 340b cost saving, transfer the drug to
          a new drop ship draft and await the next recalculation of 340b accumulations.
          Not all patients are eligible for 340b, so it is important to cross-reference
          the recent encounter locations and the locations where prescriptions were written
          to confirm eligibility. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After reviewing the accumulations, click submit to transmit the order
          from Epic to ABC. Open the order in ABC and punch out to <span class="italic-text">
            MacroHelix

        <h3>
          Ordering
        </h3>
        <p>
          To purchase any third-party drugs, a purchase order (PO) number from
          administration is required. Frequently used drugs such as Aubagio and
          Iclusig have their own specific blanket PO numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Technicians place requests for these drugs in the comments of the drop
          ship draft. When ordering, check if the drug will be ordered from the 340B or WAC
          accounts. Send an email to the administration staff, including Michael
          Vega and Diana Ornelas, and make sure to copy supervisors and the
          compliance officer. In the email, provide the drug name, NDC, quantity,
          vendor, account number, unit cost, total cost, and our cost center
          (7427173). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the PO number is received from administration, complete the order
          form and send it to the vendor via email or fax. Order forms and PO
          documents are in the <span class="italic-text">Inventory > Third-Party Vendor Drop Ship Drugs </span>folder within the Shared Drive.

          Before contacting a patient for a refill, verify active insurance coverage

          Remove the Ready At time located at the bottom right corner in WAM.
          This will separate specialty medications from outpatient medications
          by moving the fill to the bottom of the Ready to Fill queue.

        <h3>Specialty Pharmacy Encounters</h3>
        <p>
          Refill notes, clinical reassessments (RA), MyChart communications, and future follow-up
          coordinations occur in Epic Hyperspace's Specialty Pharmacy Encounter. From the Refill Coordination report, right-click on the
          patient and select 'Encounter.' 
          <img src="img/right_click_encounter.png" alt="" style="width: 70%; margin: 20px 0;">
          <br>
          A window will appear, displaying a list of open encounters
          at the medical center. Check if a Specialty Pharmacy Encounter has already
          been created for this month's fill.

          <p>
            Document all pharmacy tasks related to the patient's medication fill
            in the Progress Notes. Some tasks include:
            <ul>
              <li>insurance rejection</li>
              <li>conversation with the patient</li>
              <li>sending MyChart message</li>
              <li>leaving voice mail</li>
              <li>refill coordination</li>
              <li>clinical reassessment</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Specialty Pharmacy Tab</h4>
          <p>
            The Specialty Pharmacy tab is used to monitor adherence, update the medication
            and allergies list, document Drug Utilization Review (DUR), symptoms, and interventions, track patient
            financial savings, and record patient quality of life. Fill out the
            Specialty Pharmacy tab after scheduling a refill or completing a clinical reassessment.
            <br>

          </p>
          <h4>Wrap Up Tab</h4>
          <p>
            The Wrap Up tab is used for scheduling future follow-ups. Make
            sure to always select the Refill Coordination checkbox and have a
            follow-up date. The patient will not populate in the Refill Coordination
            report if any of these parameters are missing. Also select the Clinical
            Reassessment checkbox if it was completed for this encounter.

          </p>
          <h4>Enrollment Tab</h4>
          <p>
            Patients are enrolled in the management program through the Enrollment tab.
            Enrollments take place during the First Fill Review, while disenrollments
            occur when patients no longer receive our services. It's advisable to confirm patient's
            enrollment before scheduling the next follow-up, particularly for
            returning patients who have resumed using our services.
            Disenrolled patients will not appear on the Refill Coordination report.
            <br>
            <img src="img/enrollment_tab.png" alt="" style="margin: 20px 20px 0;">
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Only sign encounters if no additional follow-ups are needed for the current month's fill
          (completing refill coordination without needing an intervention for a patient).
          Encounters that are pending patient contact, need a pharmacist's intervention,
          or require a clinical reassessment should not be signed. A pharmacist will
          review and sign the encounter for interventions or clinical reassessments
          during verification.
          <br>

        </p>

        <h3>Scheduling Refills</h3>
        <p>
          Prior to contacting the patient for refills, check the patient notes on
          the refill report and pharmacy notes in the patient's WAM profile for
          the reassessment (RA) due date and any other relevant information relating
          to the patient. Additionally, verify if the patient is enrolled to receive
          MyChart messages. Follow the patient outreach diagram provided below for
          specialty and soft specialty medications.
        </p>
        <h4>Specialty (Category A, PMP, True Specialty)</h4>
        <p>
          Up to six attempts will be made to contact the patient. If the patient is
          enrolled in MyChart, alternate between sending MyChart messages and making
          phone calls. In case reaching the patient remains unsuccessful after the sixth
          attempt, remove the wrap-up date and escalate the encounter to the clinical
          pharmacist due to noncompliance.
        </p>
        <img src="img/refill_outreach_pmp.png" alt="" style="width: 110%;">
        <p>
          If the patient is not opted out of the patient management program (PMP),
          screen the patient during the refill call for the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Days supply on hand/next injection due date/next cycle start date</li>
            <li>Changes to the current medication (direction/dose)</li>
            <li>Changes to the patient's medication profile (new medications/discontinued medications)</li>
            <li>New allergies</li>
            <li>Side-effects</li>
            <li>Medication efficacy (working a little, a lot, can't tell)</li>
            <li>Adherence (missed/late doses)</li>
            <li>Quality of life (1-10 best)</li>
          </ul>
          If the patient mentions any changes, it is considered an intervention, and the encounter should be routed to the pharmacist (PV2) under the Wrap Up tab.
          <br>
          <img src="img/routing.png" alt="" style="margin: 20px 0;">
        </p>

        <h4>Soft Specialty (Category B)</h4>
        <p>
          The patient will be contacted up to three times. Use the smart texts
          ".SOFTSPLASTMYCHART" for the final MyChart message and ".SOFTSPLASTNOTE"
          for the final progress note.
        </p>
        <img src="img/refill_outreach_softsp.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h4>Shipping</h4>
        <p>
          We offer two shipping services: DCS for Orange County deliveries and
          FedEx Express for deliveries outside Orange County. No deliveries occur
          on weekends or holidays, and we do not ship out of state.
          Refer to the provided tables when scheduling a delivery.
        </p>

        <img src="img/shipping_table.png" alt="" style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <p>
          Include the <span class="italic-text">Mail Order</span> flag in WAM with the ship date. <br>
          If the patient has Medicare Part B or Humana Part D insurance, a signature is mandatory for the delivery.
        </p>
        <h4>Pick Up</h4>
        <p>
          Ask for the date and time if the patient is picking up. Check with the pharmacist (PV2)
          if the patient wants to pick up on the weekend.
        </p>
        <h4>After Scheduling</h4>
        <p>
          Restock the medication by adding the NDC in the specialty inventory draft.
          Print and fill out the <span class="italic-text">Call Slip</span> to serve as the cover sheet for your order basket.
