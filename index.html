        <h3>Receive Drop Ship</h3>
        <p>
          FedEx drop ship packages are directly delivered to Outpatient
          Pharmacy, while UPS drop ship packages are typically delivered to
          Inpatient Pharmacy. UPS packages usually consist of drugs sourced
          from Amerisourcebergen's alternative distribution center,
          directly from the manufacturer (such as Ninlaro, Prevymis, and
          manufacturer replacements), and some third-party vendor drugs (like Aubagio).
        </p>
        <p>
          For any missing packages, check with Inpatient Pharmacy store room
          staff and the dock. If the packages are not found, contact Infusion
          Pharmacy and IDS pharmacy to see if they have received
          our missing packages.

          The tracking number can be accessed on the ABC Order website under
          <span class="italic-text tooltip">Ordering > Order History
          <span class="tooltip-img"><img src="img/order_history.png" alt=""></span></span>.
          If the tracking number is not listed, reach out to Amerisourcebergen for
          tracking assistance.

        <h4>Updating Inventory</h4>
        <p>
          When scanning drugs into Epic Inventory, prioritize the ones that are
          pending from the <span class="tooltip">FOA<span class="tooltip-text" id="foa">
          Fill on arrival </span></span> area. Ensure that both the lot number and
          expiration date are recorded. Manually update the inventory for
          third-party vendor drugs and drugs that cannot be scanned into Epic.
          Include the quantity received, purchase order number, lot number, and
          expiration date in the comments.
        </p>
        <h4>Confirming Invoices</h4>
        <p>
          Confirm the invoices in Epic for the received drugs, and record the
          corresponding PO and invoice numbers on the <em>Pharmacist Acceptance
          of Drop Shipment Order</em> form (signed by the receiving pharmacist).
        </p>
        <p>
          Scan <span class="tooltip">T3 documents<span class="tooltip-text" id="t3">
          Packing slips that include the transaction history (TH), transaction
          information (TI), and transaction statement (TS).</span></span>
          associated with drugs sourced from third-party vendors or directly
          from the manufacturer into the Shared Drive for uploading onto Tracelink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submit the invoices for approval on the ABC Order website, under

        <h3>Order Drop Ship</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure timely delivery, submit drop ship orders by 1 PM from
          Monday to Thursday. With the exception of urgent FOA orders, it is
          best to avoid submitting drop ship orders on Fridays to avoid potential
          delivery exceptions as the weekend approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drop ship drugs are identified in the ABC Order catalog with the
          <span class="italic-text">DROPSHIP</span> label or the
          <span class="italic-text">Ship separately</span> indicator.

          Requesting technicians place these drugs in a separate order draft in
          Epic labeled as <span class="italic-text">SP Dropship</span>. Most drugs
          are available for purchase from both our 340b and RAC accounts. However,
          some drugs are exclusively 340b and require verification of 340b
          accumulations on <a href="https://web.mhiapps.com/" target="_blank">Macro Helix</a>.
          Exclusively 340b drugs can be identified in the ABC Order catalog by the
          absence of the RAC price tag.
